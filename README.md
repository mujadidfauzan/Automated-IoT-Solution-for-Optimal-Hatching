# Automated IoT Solution for Optimal Hatching

## Description
This project develops an IoT-based automated egg incubator that optimizes hatching success by monitoring temperature and humidity in real-time. Using **ESP32**, this system allows users to remotely manage and monitor the incubation environment via an IoT platform, reducing costs and increasing productivity.

## Features
- Real-time temperature and humidity monitoring
- Remote control using ThingESP and WiFi
- IoT integration for automation and alerts
- Adjustable parameters for optimal hatching conditions

## Components
- ESP32
- DHT11 Sensor (temperature and humidity)
- ThingESP Library
- WiFi connection (for IoT integration)
